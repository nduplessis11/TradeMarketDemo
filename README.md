# Tradewell Market

**Tradewell Market** is an online platform that connects artisan sellers with niche buyers who value craftsmanship and unique products. The platform focuses on small-batch, limited-edition items, with a business model that introduces unique terms and rules governing transactions.

## Key Concepts

### Craftbatches
Products on Tradewell Market are sold in limited quantities known as **Craftbatches**. Each Craftbatch has a unique identifier, and once it’s sold out, it’s gone forever. Sellers often announce upcoming Craftbatches in advance, creating anticipation among buyers.

### Vault Reservations
Buyers can reserve items before a Craftbatch goes live through **Vault Reservations**. This is a special privilege awarded to repeat buyers or those who have earned enough **TrustPoints**.

### TrustPoints
Tradewell Market features a loyalty system where buyers earn **TrustPoints** through purchases, reviews, and referrals. TrustPoints can be redeemed for early access to Craftbatches, discounts, or even customization options.

### Custom Orders
Some Craftbatches offer **Custom Orders**, allowing buyers to request modifications to items (e.g., a different color, size, or material). Custom Orders require seller approval and may have longer lead times.

### Chain of Custody
Given the unique nature of the products, Tradewell Market tracks the **Chain of Custody** to ensure authenticity and provenance. This includes documentation of who crafted the item, who sold it, and all previous owners if the item is resold.

### Echo Market
Tradewell Market includes a secondary market, the **Echo Market**, where buyers can resell their items. The original seller can receive a small commission from resales if it’s within a specified timeframe.

### Capsule Drops
**Capsule Drops** are periodic events where multiple Craftbatches from different sellers are released simultaneously. These events often have a theme (e.g., "Winter Wonders") and generate significant buzz within the community.

## Unique Rules

### No Reproductions
Once a Craftbatch is sold out, it cannot be reproduced by the same seller for at least one year. This rule keeps the market fresh and ensures that items remain special.

### Transparent Customization
If an item is customized, the changes must be documented in the Chain of Custody to maintain transparency for future resales.

### Limited Vault Spots
**Vault Reservations** are limited and can only be held for 48 hours before the Craftbatch goes live. If not claimed, the spot is forfeited, and the next buyer in line gets the opportunity.

### Escrow Payments
Payments on Tradewell Market are held in **escrow** until the buyer confirms receipt of the item. This system fosters trust between buyers and sellers, particularly for high-value transactions.
